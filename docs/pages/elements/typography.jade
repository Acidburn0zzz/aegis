  h1.splash.docs-page-header Typography

  section.docs-section#heading
    h1.docs-h1 Headings
    p.
      Perhaps starting off showing off the typographic features is best left to long
      paragraphs of text, which not only set the tone for the features to come, but
      also offer a contrast to the big burly blocks of heading texts.
    p.
      What Aegis offers in typography is carefully proportioned text and header texts
      of all forms.

    .example.docs-eg
      h1 H1 - Largest Heading
      h2 H2 - Slightly Smaller one
      h3 H3 - You'd use this more
      h4 H4 - Small Heading
      h5 H5 - Tiny Heading

  section.docs-section#paragraph
    h1.docs-h1 Paragraphs
    p.
      Paragraphs, as already shown above, are the centerpiece of any website. To demonstrate
      the paragraph styles, here is a short snippet of literature presented in a
      <strong>13px font-size</strong> with a <strong>line-height of 21px</strong>.
      In ems, this line-height would come to <strong>1.62em</strong>.

      h3.text-center Youth
      h5.text-center by Isaac Asimov (an excerpt)
      p.
        "The atomic bombs," returned the Astronomer, "need not be the end of
        civilization. These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb, or whatever
        their equivalent was on their own worlds, and survived it, because they
        didn't give up. Don't you see? It wasn't the bomb that defeated us, but
        our own shell shock. This may be the last chance to reverse the
        process."

      p.
        "Tell me," said the Industrialist, "what do these friends from space
        want in return?"

      p.
        The Astronomer hesitated. He said, "I will be truthful with you. They
        come from a denser planet. Ours is richer in the lighter atoms."

      p "They want magnesium? Aluminum?"

      p "No, sir. Carbon and hydrogen. They want coal and oil."

      p "Really?"

      p.
        The Astronomer said, quickly, "You are going to ask why creatures who
        have mastered space travel, and therefore atomic power, would want coal
        and oil. I can't answer that."

      p.
        The Industrialist smiled. "But I can. This is the best evidence yet of
        the truth of your story. Superficially, atomic power would seem to
        preclude the use of coal and oil. However, quite apart from the energy
        gained by their combustion they remain, and always will remain, the
        basic raw material for all organic chemistry. Plastics, dyes,
        pharmaceuticals, solvents. Industry could not exist without them, even
        in an atomic age. Still, if coal and oil are the low price for which
        they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth, my answer
        is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis."

      p The Astronomer sighed and said, "There are the boys!"

      p.
        They were visible through the open window, standing together in the
        grassy field and lost in animated conversation. The Industrialist's son
        pointed imperiously and the Astronomer's son nodded and made off at a
        run toward the house.

      p.
        The Industrialist said, "There is the Youth you speak of. Our race has
        as much of it as it ever had."


  section.docs-section#list
    h1.docs-h1 Lists
    p.
      Lists are perhaps one of the most used elements in online typography
      after paragraphs. Here are the different styles aegis offers you:

    article.docs-article#ul
      h3.docs-h3 Unordered Lists
      p.
        Unordered lists or <code>ul</code> are the ones having a plain listing without
        any particular order or preference given to the items.
      .example.docs-eg
        .docs-eg-object
          ul
            li Step 1: Add a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag
            li Step 2: Add a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag
            li Step 3: Write Text in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
        pre.docs-eg-code.
          &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;

    article.docs-article#ol
      h3.docs-h3 Ordered Lists
      p.
        Ordered lists <code>ol</code>, on the other hand, have their items
        arranged in ordered manner.

      .example.docs-eg
        .docs-eg-object
          ol
            li Number 1
            li Number 2
            li Number 3
        pre.docs-eg-code.
          &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;

    article.docs-article#no-list
      h3.docs-h3 Unstyled or No-List
      p.
        Many times, those pesky little dots and margins need to be removed,
        for example in a menu listing, or as in the sidebar here.
        For those times, add a <code>.no-list</code> class
        to your <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> lists.

      .example.docs-eg
        .docs-eg-object
          ul.no-list
            li To use an unstyled list, write ul
            li Add a no-list class to it
            li And voil√†!
          pre.docs-eg-code.
            &lt;ul class=&quot;no-list&quot;&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

    article.docs-article#inline
      h3.docs-h3 Inline Lists
      p Inline lists, handy in navbars.
      .example.docs-eg
        .docs-eg-object
          ul.inline
            li Inline
            li Lists
            li Make
            li Horizontal
            li Menus
            li Fun
            li Innit
        pre.docs-eg-code.
          &lt;ul class=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;

  section.docs-section#code
    h1.docs-h1 Code Highlighting
    p.
      You also get a simple background highlighting for inline-code and code-blocks.
      <em>(todo)</em> The code-highlighting itself is provided thanks to CodeMirror.
      To use, just wrap a code within a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> block.

    article.docs-article#code-inline
      h3.docs-h3 Inline Code
      p.
        To get monospaced and highlighted code, wrap a piece of text
        in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.</p>

      .example.docs-eg
        .docs-eg-object.
          Writing <code>HTML</code> is a breeze with SublimeText.
        pre.docs-eg-code.
          &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt;

    article.docs-article#code-block
      h3.docs-h3 Block Code
      p.
        Similarly, just wrap your code snippet within a
        <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tab to get a block of code.

      .example.docs-eg
        pre.docs-eg-object.
          (function() {
            alert("To show this code, wrap this code in a &lt;pre&gt; tag!"
             ");
          })();
        pre.docs-eg-code.
          &lt;pre&gt;
            code... code... code
          &lt;/pre&gt;

  section.docs-section#utility
    h1.docs-h1 Utility Classes
    p.
      There are several utility classes provided which can be used to modify the
      default behaviour of the text.

    article.docs-article#align
      h3.docs-h3 Alignment
      p Use alignment classes to realign the text blocks.

      .example.docs-eg
        .docs-eg-object
          p.text-left.col-4.
            <strong>LEFT</strong><br>The Industrialist smiled.
            "But I can. This is the best evidence yet of the
            truth of your story.
          p.text-center.col-4.
            <strong>CENTER</strong><br>Superficially, atomic power would
            seem to preclude the use of coal and oil.
          p.text-right.col-4.
            <strong>RIGHT</strong><br>However, quite apart from the energy
            gained by their combustion they remain, and always will remain, the
            basic raw material for all organic chemistry. Plastics, dyes,
            pharmaceuticals, solvents.
          p.text-justify.col-8.
            <strong>JUSTIFY</strong><br>The Industrialist smiled.
            "But I can. This is the best evidence yet of the truth of your story.
            Superficially, atomic power would seem to preclude the use of coal and oil.
            However, quite apart from the energy gained by their combustion they remain,
            and always will remain, the basic raw material for all organic chemistry.
            Plastics, dyes, pharmaceuticals, solvents.
        pre.docs-eg-code.
          &lt;p class="text-left"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p class="text-center"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p class="text-right"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p class="text-justify"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    article.docs-article#BnI
      h3.docs-h3 <strong>B</strong> &amp; <em>I</em>
      p.
        Text can be emboldened with <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> or
        <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, and italicized using either <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
        or <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags.

      .example.docs-eg

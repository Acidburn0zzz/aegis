              Along with the specific widths for tables, you also get power to control the
              widths of individual columns, so that you can fine-tune the table look.
              Apply the classes on the cells of the <strong>first row</strong> of the table,
              and the corresponding column will resized. The classes are of the form
              <code>.cells-X</code>, where <code>X</code> ranges from
              <code>1 (10% width)</code> to <code>9 (90% width)</code>.

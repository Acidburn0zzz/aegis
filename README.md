# Aegis UI

## Usage
To use the css styles as-is, just copy the aegis.css file from `docs/assets/css` folder
to your project and serve it hot with your html files with this line:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/aegis.css">

We also recommend you to use a CSS reset stylesheet such as [normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). Include this stylesheet before aegis:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/aegis.css">


## Contributing

If you want to modify Aegis for yourself, or want to contribute to the project,
you'll need the `sass` gem installed along with the `compass` framework.
Install these with:

    gem install sass
    gem install compass

Then, tell sass to watch your `aegis/sass` folder:

    sass --compass --watch sass:<output_dir>

and hack away!
